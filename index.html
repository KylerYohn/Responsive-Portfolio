        <p> Hi! My name is Kyler yohn and welcome to my portfolio website. I attended HACC (Harrisburg Area Community College) for about 3 years.
             I originally went to school for chemical engineering, but found my self really enjoying coding so I switched my career path. A little bit about me, I went to a trade highschool to learn Advirtising Art and design.
             I am also a musician, I play the drums. I have been playing drums for about 10 plus years now, and they are still my favorite passtime and hobbie to pursue.

         At the moment, I work as a barista at starbucks, and I used to work as a pharmacy technician for about 2 years before I decided to follow my new career path of programming!  
        </p>

        <p> 
            I am very excited to get further into the UPenn coding bootcamp. To see how far I can go and all the things that I can learn down the road!
        </p>
